<h3>Short Bio</h3>

<p>
Welcome! I am a researcher studying the <b>cognitive science of language</b>. Currently, I'm an MA student in the 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/ntnueng.tw/linguistics-ntnu-eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linguistics programme</a> 
at the Department of English, National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), in Taipei. There, I work in the 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/neurolinguisticslabntnu/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurolinguistics Lab</a> 
directed by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shiao-Hui-Chan-2"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiaohui Chan</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I come from sunny multilingual Singapore, and I am of Hokkien-Peranakan and Cantonese heritage. 
Before NTNU, I was an exchange student at Providence University in Taichung, Taiwan, where I studied psycholinguistics 
with Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Da-Lai"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yuda Lai</a>. 
Prior to that, I lived in Chiang Mai, Thailand, where I earned my BA in English Communication from Payap University and was 
advised by the Web-education sociologist Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Day-33"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael James Day</a>.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

<p>
My research interests mainly centre on the neuroscience underlying human language abilities. 
This requires an interdisciplinary perspective, and my process of discovery draws on methods and ideas from 
<i>experimental neuro-/psycholinguistics</i>, 
<i>theoretical linguistics</i> (especially syntax and semantics), 
<i>theoretical neuroscience</i>, 
and Whiteheadian <i><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/processp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">process philosophy</a></i>. 
</p>
<p>
I believe that <b>unification</b> between (cognitivist) linguistics and neuroscientific theory is both possible and desirable. 
This means that the <b>cognitive architecture of language</b> can be described in <b>neurobiological terms</b>. 
Theoretical linguistics in such a unification, then, can properly be seen as a subfield of theoretical cognitive neuroscience (itself a subfield of a more general science of the human).
</p>
<p>
In particular, I am interested in how linguistic structure can be explained in terms of structured neurocognitive networks at the scale of cortical minicolumns. 
This is an idea from <a href="http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/main.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurocognitive Linguistics</a> 
which I think has been under-appreciated despite its relevance to modern problems in <a href="https://www.numenta.com/blog/2019/01/16/the-thousand-brains-theory-of-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brain-inspired AI</a> and natural language processing.
See my 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research/"><strong>Research</strong></a> 
page for more details.
</p>
<p>
I will also be building a 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/index.html"><strong>Blog</strong></a> 
where I will post thoughts and musings relevant to cognitive science and linguistics. Stay tuned!
