<p class="message">"The postulation of objects as something different from the terms of relationships is a superfluous axiom and consequently a metaphysical 
hypothesis from which linguistic science will have to be freed." <cite>â€” Louis Hjelmslev</cite></p>

### Language, the Mind, and the Brain

The main theme of my research revolves around the <b>cognitive architecture of language</b>, which I believe to be inherently <b>neuromorphic</b>. That is, mental computations is not just "implemented" by neural processes, but rather, mental processes <b>are</b> neural processes. This is in contrast to most models in theoretical linguistics, which tend to treat linguistic processes at an abstract "symbolic" level distinct from but "implemented" by neural processes. 

Treating linguistic mental processes as neuromorphic is philosophically attractive because it removes the need to distinguish the mental from the physical. This consequently paves the way towards a "non-<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/" target="none">Cartesian</a> linguistics" (though I do not support pure <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/" target="none">physicalism</a> either). Discarding the mind-body dualism that has pervaded much of (classical) cognitive science is an essential first step to integrating "symbolic level" theories in linguistics with known facts about how the brain works (e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_672-1" target="none">Hebbian learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538143/" target="none">action potentials</a>, and <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/spreading-activation" target="none">spreading activation</a>).
  
### Culture: From Brains to Society

A secondary thread of my research revolves around human culture.
